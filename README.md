## A solution to agile development processes

### The Idea

Throughout my career I have used a variety of workflow tools including, Trello, Jira and Azure Devops. All of these served their need and provided a decent workflow for an agile team, however I noticed myself getting frustrated with all of them for varyious reasons. So why not try and make one myself? A good home project right?
